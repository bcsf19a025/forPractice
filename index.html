    <h4 class>Difference Between Git & Github</h4>
    <p class="ml-4">Let's start with Difference between these two terms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="ml-4">
        Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of
        your source code history
      </li>
      <li class="ml-4">
        GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git
        repositories
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First of all, you need to install
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> on your
      system which allows you to run linux commands on your system unless you
      are using Linux.
    </p>
    <p>Git allows you keep track of files you are adding.</p>

    <h4 class>Using Git</h4>
    <p>
      After you have successfully install Git, create a folder anywhere on your
      pc. If you right click, you will notice that now you have two new options
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Git Bash here & Git GUI here</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="/static/bash.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Bash Photo">
    <p>Now click on it it will look like this</p>
    <img src="/static/git-terminal.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Terminal Photo">
    <p>
      You can run command <b>git version</b> to check version of git
      you have  downloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if you run the command <b>git init</b>. This will initialize your folder as a git 
      repositry. Once you have initialized your repositry, you can add some files as a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now run the command <b>git status</b> after adding some files, you will notice that 
      it will show some red lines.Like this 
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
      <img src="/static/git-add.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Git Add">
    </div>
    <p>
      Basically how it all it all works can be described in one photo.
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
    <img src="/static/git-workflow.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Git Workflow">
    </div>
    <p>
      First when we make some changes(added some file or anything), git will realize that you have
      made some changes, now we have stage our changes. This is the <b>second step</b> in using 
      git and making commit. First you made some changes, now you will add those files to 
      the staging area.
    </p>
    <p> Run the command <b>git add .</b> on your Git Bash Terminal. What this command 
    will do will add all those files to staging area. You can also mention the file
    name incase of "." in which you have made changes.</p>
    <p>
      Now finally run the command <b>git commit -m "some useful message"</b> to commit your
      changes. 
    </p>
    <p>You have to attach some message to it, so that after some time, you or someone 
    else is looking at the code, it is well documented and any programmer can understand
    any changes. Forexample, here is how I did it:
    </p>
    <img src="/static/git-commit.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Commit Photo">
    
    <h4 class>GitHub Setup</h4>
    <p>
      Now you need to make a github Account for storing your repo online.
    </p>
    <p> You are going to need an email for making an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
    if it's your first time on Github, you will need to connect your system with your account with SSH Keys. </p>
    <p>Now after all that, you will be directed to main page of GitHub</p>
    <div class="text-center">
    <img src="/static/github_main.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHub">
    </div>
    <p>Now if you look at your left side of browser, you will see an option with 
    create a new repositry. CLilk on that option to create a new repositry.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/Github-newrepo.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHub New Repo">
    <p>
      Now you can name your repo, you can further write description about it, which tells more
      about your project. Also it asks you keep your repo private or public. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What it means it by keeping it private, only you can access it, but by keeping it public, 
      everyone can access it.  By adding README file, you can add details about your project.
      Now Clicking on create repositry will create your repositry,
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
    <img src="/static/git-intro-page.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHb Repo Page">
    </div>
    <p>
      You can see all the details to how to connect local repo to your this online repo.  
      Now click on the SSH option and copy the code and run in your git local folder.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/github-remote.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHb Remote">
    <p> In this case remote already existing that's why it is giving error. Next run the 
    git branch command to make a branch on your local repo and then push the code to your GitHub 
    Repo.
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img src="/static/github-push.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHub PUsh">
    </div>
    <p>
      Running these two commands will push your code to your Github Repo.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/file-added.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="GitHb File Uploaded">
    <p>
      You can see that file has been uplaoded on your Github Repo. You can make changes there 
      and make commits there, and git will keep the records of it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now run the <b>Pull</b> command to pull the command from that github repo you have just 
      created. THis will copy the code into the same folder with the changes you have made 
      on the github on the project.
    </p>
    <p> 
      By following the given guidline, you can make your own account and push and pull changes on 
    github and local repo. YOu can also run the command <b> git log</b> to see the history of 
    all commits made so far. 
    </p>
    <img src="/static/git-log.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Git Log">
  <h4> Branches </h4>
  <p>
    A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create a new branch run the following command.
  </p>
  <img src="/static/git-branch.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Git Branch">
  <p>
    By running these commands, you can create a new branch, do some work there and later on make some changes in it and then commit 
    them. WHen you are done you can merge it into the master branch.
